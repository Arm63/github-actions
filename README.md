# 🚀 GitHub Actions Practice Repository

Welcome to my GitHub Actions learning journey! This repository contains practice workflows, exercises, and learning materials for mastering GitHub Actions and CI/CD automation.

## 📱 **Mobile Testing Pipeline**

🔥 **NEW**: Added **parallel real device testing** for iOS and Android using Appium!

- **⚡ Parallel Execution**: iOS and Android tests run simultaneously (45% faster)
- **📱 Real Devices**: iPhone SE + Android device testing
- **🔄 CI/CD Integration**: Automatic testing on code changes
- **📊 Comprehensive Reports**: Screenshots, logs, and test results

📚 **[Complete Mobile Testing Architecture →](MOBILE_TESTING_ARCHITECTURE.md)**

## 📚 **Learning Materials**

- [`docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_LEARNING.md`](docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_LEARNING.md) - Complete guide covering all GitHub Actions concepts
- [`docs/PRACTICE_EXERCISES.md`](docs/PRACTICE_EXERCISES.md) - 10 hands-on exercises with step-by-step solutions
- [`examples/yaml-practice.yml`](examples/yaml-practice.yml) - YAML syntax examples and patterns

## 🔧 **Practice Workflows**

### **Basic Workflows**
- [`.github/workflows/hello-world.yml`](.github/workflows/hello-world.yml) - Simple "Hello World" workflow
- [`.github/workflows/ios-test-basic.yml`](.github/workflows/ios-test-basic.yml) - Advanced iOS testing workflow

### **Exercise Workflows** (Create these in `exercises/` folder)
- `exercises/system-info.yml` - Exercise 1: Basic workflow
- `exercises/multi-job.yml` - Exercise 2: Multi-job workflow
- `exercises/matrix-test.yml` - Exercise 3: Matrix strategy
- `exercises/conditional.yml` - Exercise 4: Conditional execution
- And more...

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arm63/github-actions.git
   cd github-actions
   ```

2. **Test existing workflows**
   - Go to Actions tab in GitHub
   - Run "Hello World" workflow manually
   - Check the logs and results

3. **Start with Exercise 1**
   - Read [`docs/PRACTICE_EXERCISES.md`](docs/PRACTICE_EXERCISES.md)
   - Create `.github/workflows/system-info.yml`
   - Push and test

4. **Progress through exercises**
   - Complete exercises 1-10 in order
   - Update progress table above
   - Test each workflow

## 📖 **Key Concepts Learned**

- **Workflows**: Automated processes triggered by events
- **Jobs**: Set of steps that run on the same runner
- **Steps**: Individual tasks within a job
- **Actions**: Reusable units of code
- **Runners**: Servers that execute workflows
- **Triggers**: Events that start workflows
- **Artifacts**: Files generated by workflows
- **Secrets**: Encrypted environment variables

## 🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**

- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD platform
- **YAML** - Configuration language
- **Python** - Programming language
- **Poetry** - Dependency management
- **Appium** - Mobile automation
- **macOS** - Operating system for iOS testing

## 🎯 **Goals**

- [x] Understand GitHub Actions fundamentals
- [x] Master YAML syntax
- [x] Create basic workflows
- [ ] Complete all practice exercises
- [ ] Set up self-hosted runner
- [ ] Build iOS testing pipeline
- [ ] Implement advanced features

## 📝 **Notes**

- All workflows use `workflow_dispatch` for manual testing
- iOS-specific workflows require macOS runners
- Self-hosted runners needed for real iOS device testing
- Check Actions tab for workflow execution logs
