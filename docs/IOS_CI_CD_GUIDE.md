# 📱 iOS UI Testing on GitHub Actions

## 🎯 **Quick Answer: YES, but with considerations!**

Your `one_command_ios_test.sh` script **can absolutely run on GitHub Actions**, but the approach depends on your testing needs.

---

## 🔀 **Two Main Approaches**

### **Option 1: Self-Hosted Runner (Real Device Testing)**
**✅ Pros:**
- Run your **exact** `one_command_ios_test.sh` script
- Test on **real iOS devices** 
- Full **Liveboard app testing** with login flow
- **USB device connection** support
- **Complete feature testing** (camera, GPS, etc.)

**❌ Cons:**
- Requires **dedicated macOS machine** 
- **Manual setup** of self-hosted runner
- **Device must stay connected** during tests
- **Higher maintenance** overhead

### **Option 2: GitHub-Hosted Runner (Simulator Testing)**
**✅ Pros:**
- **No setup required** - runs immediately
- **Always available** - no device connection needed
- **Faster execution** - no physical device delays
- **Free** - included in GitHub Actions minutes

**❌ Cons:**
- **iOS Simulator only** - not real device testing
- **Limited features** - no camera, GPS, cellular
- **Different behavior** - simulator vs real device differences
- **App installation** - need to build/install your app

## 🚀 **Implementation Options**

### **Option 1: Self-Hosted Runner Setup**

#### **Step 1: Setup Self-Hosted Runner**
1. **Go to your GitHub repo** → Settings → Actions → Runners
2. **Click "New self-hosted runner"**
3. **Choose macOS** and follow instructions
4. **Install on your Mac** where iPhone is connected

#### **Step 2: Use the Real Device Workflow**
The workflow `.github/workflows/ios-real-device-ci.yml` will:
- ✅ Check for connected iOS device
- ✅ Setup Python and Poetry
- ✅ Copy your iOS testing files
- ✅ Run your complete test suite
- ✅ Upload screenshots and logs

#### **Step 3: Run Your Tests**
```bash
# Manual trigger with custom parameters
# Go to Actions → iOS Real Device Testing → Run workflow
```

### **Option 2: iOS Simulator Testing**

#### **Use the Simulator Workflow**
The workflow `.github/workflows/ios-simulator-ci.yml` will:
- ✅ Create iOS simulator
- ✅ Install Appium and dependencies
- ✅ Run basic UI tests
- ✅ Upload test results

---

## 🎯 **For Your Specific Use Case**

### **Your `one_command_ios_test.sh` Script:**
```bash
# This script does:
✅ Environment setup (Node, Python, Appium)
✅ Device configuration (UDID, Team ID)
✅ Network connectivity checks
✅ Liveboard app testing
✅ Login flow automation
✅ Screenshot capture
```

### **To Run This on GitHub Actions:**

#### **Option A: Self-Hosted (Recommended)**
```yaml
# Your workflow can literally do:
- name: Run your complete test suite
  run: |
    # Copy iOS files from archive
    cp -r archive/ios-testing-project/* .
    
    # Run your script with minimal modifications
    ./one_command_ios_test.sh
```

#### **Option B: Adapt for Simulator**
```yaml
# Modify script for simulator testing:
- name: Run adapted tests
  run: |
    # Use simulator instead of real device
    # Test basic UI flows
    # Skip device-specific features
```

## 🔧 **Self-Hosted Runner Benefits**

### **For Your Workflow:**
1. **Exact same environment** - Your Mac, your setup
2. **Real device testing** - iPhone connected via USB
3. **Full app testing** - Complete Liveboard functionality
4. **Network validation** - Your WiFi connectivity checks
5. **Team ID & certificates** - Your Apple Developer setup

### **Setup Process:**
```bash
# 1. Install runner on your Mac
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
curl -o actions-runner-osx-x64.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.311.0/actions-runner-osx-x64.tar.gz
tar xzf ./actions-runner-osx-x64.tar.gz

# 2. Configure with your repo
./config.sh --url https://github.com/Arm63/github-actions --token YOUR_TOKEN

# 3. Run as service
sudo ./svc.sh install
sudo ./svc.sh start
```
